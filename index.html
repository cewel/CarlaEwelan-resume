        <div class="subheading mb-5">Hair Stylist/ Nail Techüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a hair stylist of over 35 years. I didn‚Äôt choose to do hair really. My dream was to do nails, oh how I wanted to do nails. Back then in 1990 nails were nothing like they are now, but the lady in the office talked me into doing the whole cosmetology program, ‚Äúsaying that it would be better for me in the long run‚Äù. Well, I was flat broke, getting a divorce and had no job, no education, and nowhere to live, so school was it. After finishing school I began doing hair not nails for any and everybody. Doing hair for all kinds of women, ranging in age from 3 years old to 99 years old. As a cosmetologist passing the state board on the first try I have worked and learned from some extraordinary hair stylist, barbers, braiders, hair cutters, and nail techs. I continuously try to improve my work, which is an ever ending event. I met celebrities, and celebrities hair stylists on this path of doing hair. I have worked in and been in hair shows from California to Las Vegas. 
<br><br>

         I have prided myself on perfecting the healthy growth of hair, even when the hair has been coloured correctly. I specialize in hair growth, flat ironing ‚Äúespecially virgin hair‚Äù,cutting, chemicals, nail care and applying acrylic nails both with tips and without tips. I decided back in 2011 that I should go back to school and obtain the degrees that my mother went and acquired . She went back to school at age fifty years old and received her AA, BA. Masters, and PhD. I often remember the story she told me of how long it took her to complete that first degree ‚Äú the AA‚Äù. In that story it always inspires me to continue and not stop working on my dream. It  took me seven years to get my AS. I survived ‚Äúso far‚Äù kidney failure, double pneumonia, high blood sugar levels, and a week in a coma. That cost me one semester of school, that‚Äôs it, and I returned to graduate and transfer to UCR in fall of 2020. 
<br><br>

        I have learned some of the basic hair cutting styles, and have begun an additional career as a nail tech, while continuing to better my craft of doing hair. I have seen a lot of different hair problems, and was able to pass the test of fixing the problem. I have worked on bettering myself to improve my skills in this business.  I  encourage women to take care of their hair, feet, skin and nails on a regular basis. Because I feel this gives them a sense of self worth and pride among their peers, family members, and society. Looking back at it all now I guess I needed a little bit of work on me, and there wasn‚Äôt anybody around to tell me or show me. Maybe, that‚Äôs why I feel the need to tell girls, women, even boys/ men to look at themselves three times in the mirror, hoping that one of those times they will see themselves.0
